# CodeAlpha - Machine Learning Internship Tasks

Welcome to the repository for the machine learning internship tasks completed by [Your Name] as part of the Code Alpha internship program. This repository contains the code and documentation for three distinct tasks:

1. Autism Prediction:
   In this task, the goal was to develop a machine learning model for predicting autism based on certain features. The code for this task is organized in the autism_prediction directory. The main files include:
   
    - autism_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    - data/: Folder containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.


2. Credit Score Prediction:
   The second task focused on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques. The code for this task is organized in the credit_score_prediction directory. Key files include:

    - credit_score_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.
    - credit_score_prediction_test.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for testing the model prepared on a sample dataset.
    - lgb_model.pkl: Trained model
    - data/: Folder containing the dataset utilized for training and testing the credit score prediction model.


3. Handwritten Character Recognition:
   The third task involved building a model for recognizing handwritten characters. The code for this task is stored in the handwritten_character_recognition directory. Important files are:
   
    - handwritten_character_recognition.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code for preprocessing, model training, and character recognition.
    - data/: Folder containing the dataset used to train and validate the handwritten character recognition model.

Note that all notebooks are well-commented to assist in understanding the code.

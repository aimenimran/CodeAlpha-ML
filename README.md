# CodeAlpha - Machine Learning Internship Tasks

Welcome to the repository for the machine learning internship tasks completed by Aimen Imran as part of the Code Alpha internship program. This repository contains the code and documentation for three distinct tasks:

1. Autism Prediction:
   In this task, the goal was to develop a machine learning model for predicting autism based on certain features. The code for this task is organized in the autism_prediction directory. The main files include:
   
    - autism_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    - data/: Folder containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.


2. Credit Score Prediction:
   The second task focused on predicting credit scores using machine learning techniques. The code for this task is organized in the credit_score_prediction directory. Key files include:

    - credit_score_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.
    - credit_score_prediction_test.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for testing the model prepared on a sample dataset.
    - lgb_model.pkl: Trained model
    - data/: Folder containing the dataset utilized for training and testing the credit score prediction model.
        - Note: The train dataset is to be converted from xlsx to csv before using. It was uploaded as xlsx due to large size.


3. Handwritten Character Recognition:
   The third task involved building a model for recognizing handwritten characters. The code for this task is stored in the handwritten_character_recognition directory. Important files are:
   
    - handwritten_character_recognition.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code for preprocessing, model training, and character recognition.
    - data/: Folder containing the dataset used to train and validate the handwritten character recognition model.

Note that all notebooks are well-commented to assist in understanding the code.
